# Tsuro

JavaFX implementation of the board game 'Tsuro'.

To play a card, hover over any of the three cards in your hand and click to add that card to the path. To rotate a card before it is played, hover over the card and press 'r'. As new tiles are placed, your player piece will follow the path you've created with your cards.

The goal is to place as many tiles as possible while keeping your piece on the board. 

Watch a video of the game in progress in the 'demos' folder.
